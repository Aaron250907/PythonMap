                    Corruption is the abuse of power for personal gain. It damages fairness, equality, justice, and
                    human rights.
                    This interactive report explores how corruption appears in three different countries, how it affects
                    people’s
                    lives, and what ethical leadership and ordinary citizens can do to fight it.

                <p class="section-intro">
                    Portugal is generally seen as a relatively clean and stable democracy, but it still faces corruption
                    challenges,
                    especially in politics, local government, and public contracts. Its CPI score is around the low to
                    mid-60s,
                    placing it ahead of many countries but behind the very best performers in Europe.

                                can undermine trust in institutions.

                                can create opportunities for favouritism or informal deals.

                                made it difficult for people to report wrongdoing, although this is improving.

                                politicians are corrupt,” which discourages participation and voting.

                                <strong>Whistleblower protection laws:</strong> New laws inspired by EU directives give
                                better protection
                                to people who report corruption.

                        <p>
                            Ethically, Portugal aims to uphold integrity, equality before the law, and responsible use
                            of public funds.
                            However, when individual leaders act selfishly, they break the ethical contract between
                            government and
                            citizens. The challenge is not only to punish corrupt behaviour but to create a culture
                            where honesty,
                            transparency, and accountability are normal and expected.

                    India is the world’s largest democracy with a vibrant media, active civil society, and many laws
                    designed to
                    fight corruption. At the same time, its CPI score in the high 30s reflects ongoing challenges with
                    bribery,
                    bureaucracy, and political funding.

                                registration can encourage “speed money” to move files faster.

                            Ethically, India has strong values in its constitution, including justice, equality, and
                            dignity for all.
                            The tension between these ideals and real-life corruption creates frustration but also
                            motivation for
                            reform. Students, journalists, lawyers, and activists play a critical role in demanding
                            integrity from
                            leaders and refusing to normalize bribery in daily life.

                <p class="section-intro">
                    Pakistan faces more severe corruption challenges, with CPI scores in the high 20s. Political
                    instability, weak
                    institutions, and patronage networks have allowed corruption to become deeply rooted in many
                    sectors. However,
                    there are also strong voices pushing for accountability and reform, especially among younger
                    generations.

                            Ethically, Pakistan’s struggle with corruption raises questions about justice,
                            responsibility, and
                            leadership. People who engage in corrupt acts often justify it as “the only way to get
                            things done,” but
                            this thinking harms those who are already vulnerable. Long-term change depends on
                            strengthening institutions
                            and empowering citizens who insist on fairness, honesty, and the rule of law.

                <p class="section-intro">
                    Looking at Portugal, India, and Pakistan together shows that corruption is shaped by history,
                    politics,
                    economics, and culture. No country is completely free from corruption, but the level and type of
                    corruption can
                    be very different.

                        <h3>Ethical Takeaway</h3>
                        <p>
                            Corruption is a powerful reminder that laws alone are not enough. A fair society depends on
                            people choosing
                            to act ethically even when nobody is watching. By studying real examples from Portugal,
                            India, and
                            Pakistan, we can see the consequences of corrupt choices—and the hope that comes from honest
                            leadership and
                            courageous citizens.
